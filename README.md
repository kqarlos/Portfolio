## Code Snippets

This code shows the nesting I chose to display the main content of the webpage. There is a &lt;div&gt; 'box' that takes care of the background. Inside there is a &lt;div&gt; 'content' that contains the main content of the webpage. This includes the header, image, and text. The &lt;p&gt; tags belong to the same class "paragraph" for easier styling.

This snippet shows the styling of the &lt;header&gt;. The header 'b1' was centered using margin: 0 auto. The 'name' and the 'menu' were position absolute in relation to the header.
