                <p class="paragraph">I am a student at the University of California Berkeley Web Development Coding Bootcamp. There I'm learning the latest technologies used in web developement. This is my final step to achieving my lifelong dream of becoming a developer.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">My relationship with coding began during my sophmore year of high school. I took an HTML class at UC Berkeley through an special program for high school students. Then I ffelt like I discovered a whole new world. A world I had control over. Upon completion of that class, I knew what I wanted to do for a career, programming. Right after I graduated high school in San Fan Francisco, I went to pursue a degree in Software Engineering from San Jose State University. I graduated in 2016 with a minor in Mathematics.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">Upon my completion of the coding bootcamp there is nothing that will stop me from entering the tech industry. I will be more than ready to tackle the most challenging obstacles and collaborate with the greatests minds. </p>
